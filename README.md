# Fakeception

This is a tool to convert workflows saved in Fake.app into test instructions for tools like Codeception.

## Motivation

I think Fake.app is a great method to introduce GUI users to making website scenarios. I haven't yet seen another method which is as user-friendly for a user who could reproduce the steps in a browser, but would find expressing the same in code a challenge. This functionality has been requested a few times on the Fake google group, but not provided.
